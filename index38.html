        <h3>The Amazon</h3>
        <p>Covering roughly 40 percent of South America, including parts of Brazil, Peru, and Colombia, the Amazon is
            the largest rainforest on the planet, and home to more than 40,000 plant species and 1,300 bird species
            alone. But be sure to visit the winding rivers and diverse wildlife while you can—climate change (along with
            man-made fires) is increasingly whittling away the habitat every day.</p>

        <h3>Angel Falls, Venezuela </h3>
        <p>Venezuela overflows with natural wonders, including the world’s highest waterfall: the 3,212-foot cascades
            (that’s 19 times higher than Niagara Falls) of Angel Falls, located in the UNESCO-protected Canaima National
            Park. Bonus: Pixar animators used the location as inspiration for Paradise Falls in Up—so you know it’s
            good.</p>

        <h3> Antarctica</h3>
        <p>That’s right, we put an entire continent on here. Although 99 percent of Antarctica is covered with ice, the
            landscape still manages to be stunningly diverse—surreal blue glaciers, active volcanoes, the rough
            waterways of the Drake Passage, and 360-degree views of untouched snow. And those views are made even better
            when an emperor penguin or humpback whale makes an appearance.</p>

        <h3>The Azores, Portugal </h3>
        <p>Roughly 900 miles off the coast of Lisbon, this Portuguese archipelago can inspire wanderlust with a single
            photo. The verdant valleys, steep oceanside cliffs, rows of blue hydrangeas, and scattering of waterfalls
            make the Azores a paradise worth exploring. Just make sure you visit before everyone you know beats you to
            it.</p><br /><br />

        <h3>Banff National Park</h3>
        <p>Easily one of the most beautiful spots in Canada, Banff National Park overwhelms with views of the Canadian
            Rockies and a regular cast of animals. The park is also known for its abundance of beautiful lakes,
            including Lake Louise, Moraine Lake, and glacial Lake Minnewanka—each more pristine than the last.</p>

        <h3> Cameron Highlands</h3>
        <p>It’s hard to pick just one beautiful spot in geographically diverse Malaysia, but the Cameron Highlands might
            be the winner. Located in the state of Pahang, the 275-square-mile region is home to the largest tea
            plantations in the country—a place of fuzzy green hills rolling into the distance, where you can also
            explore butterfly gardens and strawberry farms.</p>

        <h3> Cappadocia, Turkey</h3>
        <p>Cappadocia, an area in Turkey where entire cities have been carved into rock, is pretty incredible on its
            own. But whenever hot air balloons pepper the sky—with many floating up right at sunrise—its beauty level
            literally skyrockets.</p>

        <h3>Cliffs of Moher, Ireland </h3>
        <p>Few places exemplify the raw, untamed beauty of Ireland’s west coast like this natural wonder, which tops 702
            feet at the highest point. And while you might know them better as the Cliffs of Insanity from The Princess
            Bride, in reality, the cliffs are located just south of Galway.</p>

        <h3>The Great Barrier Reef </h3>
        <p>Although the Great Barrier Reef (aka the largest living thing on Earth) can be seen from space, the best
            vantage point belongs to the avid snorkelers and scuba divers who visit each year. If you must resurface, do
            it at the Whitsundays—namely Whitehaven Beach, often considered to be one of the world’s most beautiful
            beaches.(Australia)</p>

        <h3> Mount Fuji, Japan</h3>
        <p>It’s hard to pick the single most beautiful place in Japan, but 12,388-foot Mount Fuji just might take the
            prize. Visit Lake Kawaguchiko in the spring for some of the best views of the mountain and cherry blossom
            trees—a postcard-worthy sight if we ever saw one. Or if you’re an avid hiker, plan a trip for mid-July until
            the end of August, when the snow melts enough to allow access to Fuji’s summit.</p>

        <h3>Svalbard, Norway </h3>
        <p>Svalbard, the northern archipelago off the coast of Norway, is known for spectacular Northern Lights viewing
            opportunities—the sky is pitch black all day and night from October through February, due to its position
            within the Arctic Circle. Svalbard is also celebrated for its wildlife, including polar bears and arctic
            foxes who live out their days among the deep fjords and sheets of ice.</p>

        <h3>Valle de Cocora </h3>
        <p>Valle de Cocora is one of the most beautiful landscapes in Colombia—and that’s saying something. The park
            (about a 7-hour drive west of Bogotá) is filled with the tallest palm trees in the world at nearly 200 feet,
            which look even more incredible set against the backdrop of misty green hills and craggy mountains.</p>

        <h3> Wulingyuan Scenic Area</h3>
        <p>“Scenic” might be an understatement here: This 100-square-mile attraction in China’s Hunan Province contains
            thousands of sandstone pillars that are nature’s version of skyscrapers—some even stretch taller than the
            Empire State Building’s midpoint.The site also provides habitat for many vulnerable species, including the
            dhole, Asiatic black bear, and Chinese water deer.</p>

        <h3>Playa de Las Catedrales </h3>
        <p>As a destination on Europe's Iberian Peninsula, Spain is renowned for its island paradises and semi-remote
            sand beaches. We're particularly big fans of Playa de Las Catedrales, a small stretch of sand on the
            Galician coast where natural stone arches form a walkable "cathedral" at low tide.. At high tide, the beach
            seems small but is still suitable for swimming.</p>

        <h3>Palawan, Philippines </h3>
        <p>With its blue lagoons and limestone cliffs, it’s easy to see why Palawan is consistently voted one of the
            best islands in the world by our readers. It is also home to the otherworldly Puerto Princesa Subterranean
            River, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that travels five miles through an underground cave system. </p>

        <h3> Mount Kilimanjaro</h3>
        <p>Africa’s highest peak seems more striking than a lot of other famous mountains, because it’s an ancient
            stratovolcano that’s not part of any mountain range. That means the 19,000-foot summit drops down to vast,
            flat plains on all sides, making it a mirage-like blip on Tanzania’s widespread topography.</p>
